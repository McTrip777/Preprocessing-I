          <h2>My Work Experience!</h2>
          <p>I have worked a variety of different jobs, 
            all of them leading me to where I am today. 
            Through the good and the bad, pros and cons 
            of each and every job, I learned how unfair 
            the world is and that if you want something 
            you have to fight for it. With the knowledge 
            I have obtained over the years I know I can 
            succeed whenever and wherever I am. Making 
            the most of every opportunity that crosses
            my path.</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p> As you will read further down the page 
              I have worked for several places. I have
              learned all kinds of skills but even more
              important I learned those skills and made 
              them my own. I have working in the restaurant
              and retail business allowing me to build people
              skills. I have worked as a manager and team coach
              teaching me how to supervise others and make sure
              the task at hand is completed. I believe these all 
              prove I am capable and would make a great addition 
              to your team.</p>
